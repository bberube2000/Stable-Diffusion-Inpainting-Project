# Stable-Diffusion-Inpainting-Project
This project uses Metaâ€™s segment-anything open source model, Hugging Face diffusers, and Gradio to create an app that can change the background, face, clothes or anything a user selects. The purpose of this project, as adapted from W3 Schools, was to gain familiarity with generative AI models as well as classic ML frameworks like Pytorch.  

The following libraries are required in order to successfully run the AppPytorch.py file:
- Accelerate
- Diffusion
- Pillow
- NumPy
- Torch
- Gradio 
- Cuda (for non MacOs users)
